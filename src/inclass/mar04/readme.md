#  ARRAY 

# TYPE OF ARRAY 
1. ONE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY 
2. TWO- D ARRAY

# 2-D ARRAY [for each ] [for every integer element in given array print that element]

# CHARACTER ARRAY 

# STRINGS 
character array
is  a class 
non - primitive data type[that we cant change ]
strings are immutable [ that we cant change ] [because we can not change the actual object of the string ]

# 2 WAYS TO CREATE STRINGS 
1. USING STRING LITERAL 

String name = "Pragra";      {THIS name is stored in stack while PRAGRA is going to be stored in STRING CONSTANT POOL IN HEAP}

String myName = "Pragra";    {myName in stack and Pragra in STRING CONSTANT POOL IN HEAP}

[TO SAVE MEMORY ]

2. NEW KEYWORD

String name = new String("Pragra");      {in this Pragra directly stored in [HEAP] as object }
