# MUTABLE STRINGS 
1. STRING BUFFER [thread-safe ] [multi code @ same time, ][inconsistency, slower due to synchronization ]
2. STRING BUILDER [not-thread safe][only one code@ one time ][consistency, faster due to non synchronization]


# INTERVIEW [ IMP DIFF BETWEEN STRING, STRING BUILDER, STRING BUFFER ][ IN TERMS OF MUTABLE AND MUTABILITY  ]



# OOPS [PILLAR OF OOPS]
1. INHERITANCE
[reusability] 
Previous features were also reused and added back so that we don't have written the code for it again and again
SUPPORT [MULTI] [USE EXTENDS]
DON'T SUPPORT [MULTIPLE] [MULTIPLE BUT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY INTERFACES]

2. POLYMORPHISM
[Poly - many morphism - forms]

one thing could behave differently in diff situation.

insulators     - rubber, wood
Semiconductors - in some scenarios they conduct elect, in some they restrict
conductor   - silicon, iron, water 

Method will behave differences in diff situations
[Method overloading] - [Compile time Polymorphism]
[Method Overriding ] - [ Run time Polymorphism ] 


3. ABSTRACTION
[Hiding the complex details] from the user and only showing whatever is necessary . 
abstract - some form of idea , 
overview 
CAR ------> you need to learn how the engine works to drive car

4. ENCAPSULATION 
[wrapping up the data into a single unit]
you are only allowing user to access the data which you only want them to access
WhatsApp ---> status ----> number of users who can see the status
Profile - lock your profile friend list - you can not access

[Data hiding] - [Abstraction / Encapsulation]
