constructor initialize the instance variable 

2. LOCAL VARIABLE

3. STATIC VARIABLE

# STATIC 
1. VARIABLE 
2. METHOD 
3. CLASS ====> STATIC INNER CLASS, INNER CLASS, ANONYMOUS INNER CLASS >>>> LATER 
4. BLOCK [IT WILL RUN BEFORE ANY METHOD BCZ IT WILL LOAD IN THE MEMORY FIRST ]
5. INSTANCE 

# ANONYMOUS OBJECT 
which dont have reference name

# JVM, JRE, JDK 


# ARRAY 
collection of homogeneous data types 

# REVERSE ARRAY & MINI AND MAX ARRAY 


# new keyword gives memory to object and stored in heap memory;
# static instance run whenever every instance is created and static block run whenever the class is created 

# why main method id static 
bcz we don't need to create the object of static method in the same class 

# all static methods stored in the method area called meta space
